# Multi-Function Python Project

Welcome to a versatile Python project that integrates several useful applications into one program. From a shopping list to a to-do list, calculator, and fun games like "Guess a Number" and "Guess a Word", this project offers both utility and entertainment in a simple, user-friendly interface.

## Features:
